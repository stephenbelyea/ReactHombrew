from the ground up while follow a pretty killer guide.

## Based on [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/)

from the setup steps in SurviveJS. Do check it out, if
you haven't already, and considering buying the book(s).

- To serve live-reload dev environment, run `npm start`.
- To build the production copy, run `npm run build`.

## Versions
