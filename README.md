# React Homebrew
Webpack and Babel config for React. Built incrementally,
from the ground up while follow a pretty killer guide.

## Based on [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/)
All npm, webpack, and app dir config is ripped directly
from the setup steps in SurviveJS. Do check it out, if
you haven't already, and considering buying the book(s).

## Getting Started
- At the project root, run `npm install`.
- To serve live-reload dev environment, run `npm start`.
- To build the production copy, run `npm run build`.

## Versions

building manifest, clear caching with file hases, cleaning dir
on build cmd, styles to separate CSS file, install PureCSS lib,
cleanup unused styles, analyze build stats, deploy to GitHub on

### v0.1 - [Developing with Webpack](http://survivejs.com/webpack/developing-with-webpack/)
